### About This App


*Hawaiian Monk Seals at Kalaupapa National Historical Park* is an app that lets you visualize [Kalaupapa National Historic Park](https://www.nps.gov/kala/index.htm)'s monk seal survey data. From the top navigation panel you'll be able to access a seal genealogy tree, observed seal locations, graphs displaying seal observation data, as well as mother and pup characteristics. Additionally, using the side panel to the left, you can dive into the life history of this special marine species.

### Creators and Data Source


This app was created by Katherine Rosencrance, Annie Combs, and Alessandra Puig-Santana for the course ESM 244 - Advanced Data Analysis at the University of Santa Barbara. Data were obtained from Glauco Puig-Santana, a biological technician working at Kalaupapa National Historical Park. The data are not publicly available, but the original data files contained seal and pup observations dating back to 2021 and genealogy data beginning in 1997. The side panel tab "NPS Surveys" details the data collection methods used for the data included in this app. Enjoy!
